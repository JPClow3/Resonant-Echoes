# 📜✨ RESONANT ECHOES ✨📜
### _A Chronicle Woven from Light, Choice, and the Fading Song_

**Hark, Seeker of Echoes!** You stand at the precipice of **Resonant Echoes**, a living chronicle whispered into existence upon the digital loom. Within this realm, your every choice shall sculpt the unfolding narrative, forge bonds, and determine the fate of Aerthos, a world teetering on the precipice as the divine Aethel Song fades into the encroaching silence of the Unraveling.

You are a **Confluence Point**, a soul uniquely attuned to the **Weave** of reality, gifted with the rare ability to perceive and interact with **Echoes** – the lingering psychic imprints of past events, potent emotions, and the very energies that bind creation. These are the threads of history, and you, Resonator, are the weaver.

Forged in the luminous heart of Google's Gemini and visualized through the arcane lens of Imagen, Resonant Echoes offers a deeply personal and ever-evolving pilgrimage into a world where the past is not merely remembered, but palpably felt.

## 📜 Whispers of Aerthos (The World)

The very fabric of Aerthos is woven from **Echoes**. These are not mere specters of memory, but tangible vestiges of what has transpired – a whispered vow, the crescendo of a forgotten battle, the dying luminescence of a celestial body, or the indomitable will of a civilization lost to time. The **Silent Architects**, beings of immense power and mystery, once sculpted this reality, their cyclopean structures now slumbering ruins, thrumming with primordial energies.

Yet, a shadow lengthens. The **Aethel Song**, the cosmic symphony that underpins all existence, wanes. In its stead, the **Unraveling Song** rises – a cacophony of **Dissonance** that corrupts the pure Echoes, distorts the Weave of reality, and threatens to engulf all in an abyss of nothingness.

You, Resonator, are a **Confluence Point**, an individual whose spirit resonates with a clarity rarely seen, granting you this profound connection to the Echoes. Your path will lead you through lands saturated with ancient magic and tainted by the creeping blight, where disparate factions vie for dwindling power and forgotten truths lie dormant, awaiting a keen mind and a courageous heart to bring them to light. Will you be the one to mend the fracturing Weave, or will your passage merely hasten its descent into oblivion?

## 🛠️ The Arcane Engineering (Technology Behind the Veil)

The manifestation of Resonant Echoes upon your scrying device is achieved through a confluence of sophisticated enchantments from the world beyond Aerthos:

*   **The Oracle's Mind (AI Narrative & Logic)**: The tale is dynamically woven by the **Google Gemini API** (specifically, the `gemini-2.5-flash` incantation). Its responses are shaped by the sacred `CORE_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION` and a grimoire of prompt templates located within the `constants.ts` scroll.
*   **The Seer's Eye (AI-Generated Imagery)**: The evocative visions and spectral landscapes are conjured forth by **Google Imagen 3** (specifically, the `imagen-3.0-generate-002` variant), a potent iteration of Google's image generation alchemy, breathing visual life into the narrative's most poignant moments.
*   **The Muse's Breath (AI-Generated Video)**: The introductory cinematic is brought to life by **Google VEO** (specifically, the `veo-2.0-generate-001` variant), which translates textual prompts into moving pictures.
*   **The Artisan's Craft (Frontend Framework)**: The interactive tapestry is rendered through **React** and inscribed with **TypeScript**, ensuring a responsive and resilient experience.
*   **The Cartographer's Tools (Styling)**: The visual aesthetic is achieved with **Tailwind CSS** (invoked via CDN for swift incantation) and bespoke CSS spells enshrined within `index.html`.
*   **The Portal Glyphs (Module System)**: The ancient scripts of **ES Modules** and **Import Maps** (found in `index.html`) directly summon React and the Google GenAI SDK into your browser's realm, no complex bundling rituals required for local development.
*   **The Mind's Eye (State Management)**: The ever-shifting state of your journey is meticulously tracked by React's `useReducer` hook, a powerful yet elegant mechanism.

## 🔮 Attuning Your Orb (Local Setup & Invocation)

To embark upon your own weaving of Resonant Echoes upon your local apparatus:

1.  **The Keystone of Power (API Key)**:
    *   This chronicle requires a sacred pact with the Google AI Studio. You must possess a **Google Gemini API Key**.
    *   Guard this key well! Inscribe it into an `.env` file at the root of your local sanctum, like so:
        ```env
        API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
        ```
    *   The application reads this key via `process.env.API_KEY`. **Without this key, the Oracle cannot speak, and the Seer cannot see.** The application will alert you if this keystone is missing.

2.  **Unveiling the Scroll (`index.html`)**:
    *   Simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser that honors the ancient ways of ES Modules and Import Maps (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari are worthy vessels).
    *   There is no complex build step required for local development and play. The spells are woven directly.

3.  **The Weave Unfurls**:
    *   Upon opening, the application will initialize. If your API Key is correctly placed, the path to character creation will open before you.
    *   Should the Weave become tangled (errors occur), the application will guide you.

## 🌐 Broadcasting Your Chronicle: GitHub Pages & Custom Domains

Once your unique recension of Resonant Echoes is ready to be shared with other Seekers, you may wish to host it upon the global tapestry of GitHub Pages.

### Preparing Your Chronicle for Deployment

Unlike local invocation, broadcasting your tale via GitHub Pages typically requires a **build step**. This ritual transmutes your TypeScript (`.tsx`) and JSX into pure JavaScript that all browsers comprehend, bundles your assets, and crucially, embeds your `API_KEY` directly into the client-side scripts.

*   **Build Tools**: Consider potent incantations like Vite, Parcel, or a custom script invoking `tsc` and `esbuild`.
*   **API Key Caution**: Embedding your API key directly in client-side code makes it visible. For personal projects or demos with restricted keys, this is acceptable. For wider distribution or if your key has significant permissions, routing API calls through a secure backend proxy is the wiser path.

The output of this build ritual (usually a `dist` or `build` folder) will contain static `index.html`, JavaScript, and CSS files ready for GitHub Pages.

### Configuring GitHub Pages

1.  **Repository**: Ensure your chronicle resides in a GitHub repository.
2.  **Build Output**: Push the contents of your `dist` or `build` folder to your repository, often to a `gh-pages` branch, or to the `main` branch (in the root or a `/docs` folder).
3.  **`.nojekyll` File**: To ensure GitHub Pages serves your React application correctly without attempting to process it as a Jekyll site, place an empty file named `.nojekyll` in the root of your publishing source (e.g., the `gh-pages` branch or the root of `main` if deploying from there).
4.  **GitHub Pages Settings**: In your repository, navigate to `Settings` > `Pages`.
    *   Under "Build and deployment", select your source (e.g., "Deploy from a branch").
    *   Choose the correct branch (e.g., `gh-pages`) and folder (usually `/ (root)`).
    *   Save. Your site will soon be live at `YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/`.

### Weaving a Custom Domain

To grant your chronicle a more memorable and unique address:

*   **Supported Custom Domains**: GitHub Pages works well with **apex domains** (e.g., `resonantechoes.game`) and **`www` subdomains** (e.g., `www.resonantechoes.game`). Custom subdomains (e.g., `play.resonantechoes.game`) are also supported.
    *   It's often recommended to use a `www` subdomain, even if you also set up an apex domain, as GitHub Pages can automatically handle redirects between them if configured correctly.
*   **CNAME File**: If publishing from a branch (not a GitHub Actions workflow), a `CNAME` file (all uppercase) containing your custom domain (e.g., `www.resonantechoes.game`) must exist in the root of your publishing source. This can often be configured via repository settings, which creates the file for you.
*   **DNS Configuration**: With your domain registrar (e.g., Namecheap, GoDaddy, Google Domains), you'll need to configure DNS records:
    *   For an **apex domain**: `A` records pointing to GitHub Pages IP addresses.
    *   For a **`www` subdomain** or **custom subdomain**: A `CNAME` record pointing to `YOUR_USERNAME.github.io`.
    *   Refer to the [official GitHub Pages documentation on custom domains](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) for the most current IP addresses and detailed instructions.
*   **HTTPS**: GitHub Pages provides free HTTPS for custom domains once correctly configured. This may take up to an hour to activate after setup. If you use CAA records, ensure `letsencrypt.org` is authorized.
*   **Troubleshooting**:
    *   **CNAME Errors**: Ensure the `CNAME` file is correctly named, contains only one domain, and the domain is unique across GitHub Pages.
    *   **DNS Misconfiguration**: Use tools like `dig` or online DNS lookup services to verify your DNS records.
    *   **Unsupported Domain Names**: Avoid using more than one apex domain or certain complex subdomain combinations for a single site. Do not use wildcard DNS records.
    *   **Browser Cache**: Clear your browser cache if you've recently changed domains and can't access the new URL.
